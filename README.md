- Hey there!
- I'm a Neophile, love music, interested in Astronomy and coding, an amateur game-hacker (you can call me a cheater in CSGO/VALORANT)
- I'm not someone who know's everything but I'm someone who wants to know everything. I'm passionate about learning, Coding and this is the very beginning of my coding career.
- My goal is to learn and shape myself as much as possible.

- "I am something of a scientist myself." -Norman Osborn, I'm highly interested in Physics and Maths, and this is the reason why my family thinks I can be anything I want to be
- The main ingredient for achieving anything is hardwork, I'm a person who believes in Hard work.
- Rest lies in the future
